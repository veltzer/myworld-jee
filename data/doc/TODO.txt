- put all the data that I have in the datasets folder into the database
	and get ridd of that folder.
- load the key file from twitter into the database as a blob
	and use it that way.
	(create a table of blobs for that with a string as well as int as keys).
- create a php script that shows statistics about the database:
	lists all tables and shows how many records they have.
- add a table called backups which will store when backups were taken.
	each time you take a backup add a record to that table.
	do a php that shows when backups were taken.
- in the Work section these things need to be done:
	- add tags to the works. Make tags be arranged in a graph.
		if one searches for tag A then he will also find everything that
		is tagged under B if A->B and everything tagged C if B->C.
	- print length and size in human readable form (are there modules
		like that in PHP ? find, install and use them).
		add stats about total size and total length.
	-5. make the works.php page use groups for real.
		how do I test that ? Plug in some video data too.
	-4. document how to produce field utilization and cut fields in size.
	-3. add a flag to make warnings errors and document it.
	-1. generate length for each work.
		- find out what the best data type for length is.
		- do a script which measures length of works.
	0. each page generated should have statistics about how long
		it took to generate it.
	1. correct the date not to be a string.
	2. multiply the date (split it into viewDate and ReviewDate).
	3. separate views:
		view should take locationId, viewerId. viewDate, remark.
		(then view should multiply viewers).
	4. separate reviews:
		reviews should take reviewerId, reviewDate, review, rating.
		(then view should multiply reviewers).
	5. separate names to a persons table (and multiply).
		(document the query needed to separate information like that...).
		Do it cleanly!
	6. add urls to works and fill them out (and display them ofcourse).
	7. add images to works and fill them out (and display them ofcourse).
