- the application that I use for scanning is the one supplied with ubuntu.

- its called xsane.

- you need to tell it where to save the image.

- I usually use the jpg file type and extension.

- I usually scan with color and full resolution (600 DPI on my scanner I think).

- I usually chmod 444 the files so that I wont accidently overwrite them.

open questions:
===============
- when I scan with full resolution I get really big images (3Megs). Any easy command
line to reduce their size ?
